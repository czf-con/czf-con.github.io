                    <h3>Exhibitors</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Robert P. Levy</strong> -> Robert is practicing software engineer with a background in embodied cognitive science and cybernetics.</li>
                        <li><strong>Daniel Temkin</strong> -> Daniel Temkin makes images, programming languages, and interactive pieces that use the machine as a place of confrontation between logic and human thought. His blog and research project esoteric.codes documents work engaging with the text of code, including experimental programming languages, code art, and other systems that break from the norms of computing. It was the 2014 recipient of the ArtsWriters.org grant, and is currently in exhibition at ZKM. He regularly performs readings from his Internet Directory project, a 37,000+ page loose-leaf book of all the .COM domains in alphabetical order; he received a commission from the Webby Awards to build an online version, a scroll of domains that takes two years to watch. </li>
                        <li><strong>Awkward Ladies Club/Amy Burek</strong> -> My interests include how cells become organisms, how letters become words, and how cat pictures become memes.  I am interested in exploring how technology has shaped the ways we communicate, interact with each other, and perceive ourselves. I find the divide between our virtual and physical selves fascinating and feel that the wackiest corners of the internet deserve documentation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lily Nguyen</strong> -> Lily Nguyen is a computational designer. By day she creates design tools for a 300-person team at Uber. By night she makes art—mostly with old cameras, sometimes with computers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Kate Compton</strong> -> showing poets how to do AI, so the poets can show us how to do AI.</li>
                        <li><strong>Daisy Tsang</strong> -> I’m a software developer and writer. I love open-source software, community work, learning new technologies, picking up new natural languages, knitting, and baking.</li>
                        <li><strong>emma rae norton</strong> -> emma "doodybrains" rae norton is a web developer and artist researching what the internet looks like</li>
                        <li><strong>Cyril Focht</strong> -> Cyril Focht is a masters student in computational media at UC Santa Cruz. He has been described as "the weirdest person I've ever met... in a good way" and it shows in his creative work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tech Workers Coalition</strong> -> We are a coalition of workers in and around the tech industry, labor organizers, community organizers, and friends. Guided by our vision for an inclusive & equitable tech industry, TWC organizes to build worker power through rank & file self-organization and education.</li>
                        <li><strong>Joseph Lukasik</strong> -> Joseph is a noosphere pioneer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Caitlyn Crites</strong> -> I refer to myself as a visual designer these days, because it’s the quickest way to say I’ve done everything from murals to icon systems. I fell in love with type + lettering while working as a sign maker at a San Francisco grocery store, and have spent the past two years learning all I can about the craft and history of making letters. Perpetually drawn to niche subjects that encourage multi-disciplinary overlap, I’m especially interested in the possibilities of type combined with illustration, animation, creative code, and 3D/virtual experiences.</li>
                        <li><strong>sukanya aneja</strong> -> Sukanya is a programmer and artist currently attending the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU.</li>
                        <li><strong>Max Kreminski</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Marlena Compton</strong> -> Marlena Compton is a software developer, writer and collaboration artist. She organizes conferences such as "Pear Conf" and "Let’s Sketch Tech!" builds software, and introduces people to pair programming. Marlena’s agile hat-trick of working for IBM, Pivotal and Atlassian, has left her with a life-long appreciation for quality code, empathy and working together with a team. Let’s Pair is her successfully funded kickstarter project.</li>
                        <li><strong>Devi Acharya</strong> -> Devi Acharya is a game developer and researcher currently pursuing her Ph.D. in Computational Media at the University of California – Santa Cruz. Her work focuses on interactive fiction and storytelling in games, particularly how we can create game systems that help players to tell stories in new ways. You can find her work at her website, www.devi-a.com, or follow her on Twitter at @dacharya64.</li>
                        <li><strong>Melanie Dickinson</strong> -> Melanie is a computational media maker and researcher, and PhD student in the Expressive Intelligence Studio at UCSC, focused on making experiences that help people engage personal meaning using playfulness, generative methods, and AI. Also loves crafting, woodcarving, cuteness, and community organizing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jasmine Otto</strong> -> Jasmine writes explorable explanations of ecological geometries. She is especially interested in latent spaces of artifact-generating rules, and how these are actively refactored by creators.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rachel Joy Victor</strong> -> Rachel Joy Victor works at the intersection of stories, design, and neuroscience, creating content and worlds that educate and build futures.</li>
